# SpeedDial-OpenCv
Learning further about HandTracking using OpenCV, I came across a tutorial that counts the number of Fingers on a Hand.  
I got an idea after seeing the tutorial to create a program that resembles the speed-dial in phones but works on HandTracking. So I created a program that calls a certain person on your speed dial according to the number of Fingers we show.


Step 1)Use twilio to get your free phone number 
Step 2)Add auth_token and account_sid in code 
Step 3)Verify your phone number


Add numbers to your to the "client_numbers" variable and you are good to go
